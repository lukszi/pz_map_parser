# zomboid_map_parser/processing/processors/__init__.py
"""
Specialized processors for different aspects of map data parsing.

This package provides dedicated processors that handle specific aspects of the
parsing pipeline. Each processor focuses on a particular domain of responsibility
while maintaining clean interfaces with other components.

Main Components:
- MapProcessor: Handles parsing of map cell data
- TileProcessor: Manages tile definitions and relationships
- SearchProcessor: Coordinates searching operations across map data
